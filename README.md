# Reading from, Writing to, and Modifying Excel/CSV files using the Pandas Python Library
run as Python3.8.8 base:Conda Kernel

### Read-Write-Pandas:
Running the Jupyter Notebooks file inside the aforementioned folder will load an excel sheet, modify it by calculating a new data column, and then export the new dataframe as a .csv and a .xlsx file.

After running the program you should see new files named "Output.xlsx" and "Output.csv"

### ModifyDataFrame-Pandas:
This Jupyter Notebooks file contains my notes and experimentation with various functions included in the Pandas Library for Python.
So far it demonstrates the capability to
- Rename Columns
- Modify the index value of Rows
- Insert new rows 
- Use the .append function to add new rows by creating a new DataFrame and adding it to the original
- Viewing the Data Types of Columns
- Demonstrate my affinity for various flavors of cookies
- Displaying the contents of individual Columns
- Displaying the contents of individual Rows
